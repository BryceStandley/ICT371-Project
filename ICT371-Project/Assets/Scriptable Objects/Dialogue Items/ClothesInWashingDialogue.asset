  sentences:
  - "\u201CThe colder water is when you wash your clothes, the less carbon emissions
    are created.\u201D\r\n"
  - "\u201CWashing your clothes with a washing machine is always going to emit some
    carbon dioxide, however washing colder can reduce the amount significantly.\u201D\n"
  - "\u201C75% of energy required to do a load of washing is used to heat the water,
    so washing cold doesn\u2019t just significantly drive down your power bill, but
    also your carbon footprint.\u201D\r\n"
