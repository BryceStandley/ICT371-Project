  - "\u201CWell done TMC. You have successfully replaced all incandescent bulbs with
    energy efficient alternatives.\u201D\r"
  - "\"If every household in America were to simply replace one bulb with an energy
    efficient one, they would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 4 billion
    kilograms. Imagine how much could be reduced if every household was able to change
    every bulb!\" \r\n"
