    the door to the garage and you are free to head out for a bit while I inspect
    your performance. I suggest heading to your local grocery store to pick up your
    food order, it\u2019s only a few streets away, and I should be gone by the time
    you get back.\u201D"
  - '"As I stated earlier, you have completed all of the optional objectives too.
    You truly are a climate conscious individual. Make sure to have a read of the
    CCS documents I placed around the home if you haven''t already before you go!"'
