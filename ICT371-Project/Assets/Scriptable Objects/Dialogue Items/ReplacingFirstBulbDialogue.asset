  sentences:
  - "\u201CGood idea TMC! Replacing incandescent bulbs with energy efficient bulbs
    like compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL) or LED bulbs can reduce your carbon footprint
    and your electricity expenditure.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CEnergy efficient bulbs can last up to six times longer than incandescent
    bulbs, meaning if you were to have 20 energy efficient bulbs in your home at
    any one time, by the time you throw the 20 away, you would have used 120 incandescent
    bulbs.\""
  - '"Energy efficient bulbs save energy themselves, but they also save carbon emissions
    that would be required to transport, manufacture and dispose of the energy hungry
    incandescent bulbs."
