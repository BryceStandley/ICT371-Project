  - "\u201CHey TMC, GovBot here. I was sent by the CCS to monitor your performance
    today. Sorry for waking you up through telepathy, but we have got to get a move
    on!\u201D\r\n\u201CBefore I can let you leave your bedroom, I need you to pick
    up all your dirty clothes and put them in the laundry basket. Doing so will prove
    to me that you can listen to instructions.\u201D\n\r\n\u201COnce you\u2019ve
    filled your laundry basket, come meet me in the living room.\u201D\r"
