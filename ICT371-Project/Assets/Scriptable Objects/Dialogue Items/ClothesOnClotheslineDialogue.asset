  - "\u201CClothes dryers are one of highest power drawing appliances in the home,
    meaning they are also responsible for a heavy output of carbon emissions.\u201D\r\n\n\u201COpting
    to line-dry your clothing as opposed to machine drying them can save roughly
    1090kg of carbon emissions a year per household.\u201D\r\n\n\u201COn top of that,
    you save some money on your power bill, while also having your clothes last longer
    than they would be machined dried.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CMaybe opt for a clothesline
    over a dryer in the future.\u201D\r"
