  sentences:
  - "\u201CExcellent job TMC! You have successfully binned all the rubbish in the
    house. Placing items in the correct bin ensures that all rubbish is dealt with
    efficiently. Organic materials can be used to make gardening and farming products,
    recycling can be recycled and reused, and general waste can go to landfill.\u201D"
  - "Accidentally placing an item in the wrong bin can lead to that bin being compromised,
    leading to potentially compostable or recyclable materials ending up in landfill.\r\nLosing
    those otherwise recyclable material leads to more needing to be made, which in
    turn uses energy that leads to more carbon emissions. \r"
  - "\u201CA simple error can have a huge impact.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou placed x/x pieces
    of rubbish in the correct bins.\u201D\r"
