  sentences:
  - "\u201CExcellent job TMC! You have successfully binned all the rubbish in the
    house. Placing items in the correct bin ensures that all rubbish is dealt with
    efficiently. Organic materials can be used to make gardening and farming products,
    recycling can be recycled and reused, and general waste can go to landfill.\u201D"
  - '"Accidentally placing an item in the wrong bin can lead to that bin being compromised,
    leading to potentially compostable or recyclable materials ending up in landfill.

    Losing
    otherwise recyclable material leads to more needing to be made, which in turn
    uses energy that leads to more carbon emissions. "'
  - '"You will receive a score based on how many items you placed in the correct
    bins on your result sheet later on!"'
