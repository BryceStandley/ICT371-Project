  - "\u201CVery smart TMC!\u201D\r\n\n\u201CWhen electronic devices are off but still
    plugged in, they still use power. This leads to not only a higher than needed
    energy bill, but plenty of carbon emissions being expended that otherwise could\u2019ve
    been avoided.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUnplugging devices when not in use is an easy and effective way to reduce
    emissions in the household.\u201D\r"
